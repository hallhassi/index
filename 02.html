[gestures] This is the social field
[stims] This is the body I present
[gazes into the distance] The artist presents a body in absence, in a controlled, purified setting
[gaze passes over naked children and rests on a naked young woman] Men's gaze is religious
[imagines a book titled 'Naked Children']
[smiles at the idea]
[imagines self as Houllebeque]
[becomes self-critical of gaze then defends it again]
[makes eye contact with young woman, drops gaze]

I see a tote bag with "MATISSE" and a vegetal drawing and my brain copies it instantly
I finger the sketchbook, eager to imprint this wet impression
Decide impression is enough, go into the water to seal it

Later, gollum-like, water dripping out my nose,
notice the book i've brought - benjamin franklin's autobiography

Franklin wrote his own epitaph: 
The Body of B. Franklin, Printer; like the Cover of an old Book, Its Contents torn out, And stript of its Lettering and Gilding, Lies here, Food for Worms. But the Work shall not be wholly lost; For it will, as he believ'd, appear once more, In a new and more perfect Edition, Corrected and amended By the Author.

Another escape from the social - lying back and looking at the clouds

Laughing in the water, revealed to me anew: my love of images, of beauty

My eyes sore from opening them underwater, but having a mild fear of my invisible surroundings, I think, gaze is about knowing too, about revealing
