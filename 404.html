<pre>am i producing a silence?
am i authoring it?
on youtube i saw clickbait
i wanted to see a problematic star get taken down
but i also wanted to see that problematic in action
as something titillating, forbidden
a sort of clickbait
as something just to confirm myself as outside of that
to see a problematic force embodied outside of myself
where all that direction of hatred would hopefully go
and then
somehow actually feeling participatory on the internet
when i either open something in incognito mode
or i just don’t click on it
i don’t acknowledge that
i don’t participate in that reality
the idea of youtube as the aggregated pseudo A.I.
list of videos on the homescreen
entirely tailored to me
yet somehow still seeming universal
a reality that i create through my own participation
through my history
strange to see a video from six years ago
at 360p
today there’s 4k
um
resolution just the surface of the screen being the biggest
metric of advancement
really what else is there
viral memetic culture 
seems
part of its identity is that it seems arbitrary
random
there’s an element in there of chaos as well as fate
something that we all participate in
revel in that participation
cannot comprehend it
there’s also a sense of gangnam style
a video i never saw really
something i didn’t help to create
yet i feel included in that ‘we’ that created it
i could see similarly 
cultural stars at a certain level
kanye
also provoking this in people
a sense of how did we create this
a polarized sense of 
dismay or jubilation
this kind of resounding identification and
and a sort of violence that seems to occur
trump, same thing
‘this is me, this is my identity’
was this sort of subconscious of mine expressing itself?
