to me

Hmm coffee sounds good. Think I’m going to buy a cup. // 15-20 minutes ?

Dead means something different now

We’re modern, other side is classical , primitive
Technology and the future
A lot of energy and waste
And totally new

We were always modern
Other class other race

Poor person wearing Gucci
Drinking
Soylent

Ludic Privation
They - technological innovation
Image of authenticity
Privation as wellspring of authenticity

Being smooth brained is so relaxing
Christian victim hood martyrdom


Projections for change have been wrong
But things have changed and they will
The weather and stock market

50’s deurbanization
dandy feminism
Skin
Seth price skin poster size closeup
Toy sheen
Hairy orifeces
Skin is too specific

Blaise...
He’s doing fine
He’s great
