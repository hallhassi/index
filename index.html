thinking idea of matt thurber making art comic -- his criticality evidence of his capture
to at least that aspect of art -- but not so much embracing a 'fuck you' -- [...] (only wealthy enjoy spending money on a statement of their own consumer stupidity (self punishment? hatred of money, their image ... switches to first person

related to wit

*english accent*

is taste top down or bottom up?
imposed from above in some ways
as well as below

the architecture of the building
&amp;

my own capture if i'm being critical

wealth and the wealthy -- one and the same

the artist --
like the wealthy
but better

 -- an isolated existence 
socialized through grandiose signs
and public gestures

finding myself in common with the wealthy in being the subject of envy and hatred
as an image, one's 'life' being wanted ('i want to be that guy') 
                                     *wanted poster*
martin .. shrikelly?

idea that the artist doesn't actually need the money and really it's just a funny man to give it to... he does his little money collective act every now and then and it's always lovely and sometimes i give

imagined comics , 'how [x] makes a painting'

and ... [????
            profit]
