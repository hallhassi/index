Lungs are specialized organs for breathing air. Their delicate, porous structure, designed for gas exchange, makes them entirely unsuitable for holding and transporting liquids. People relied on organs like bladders and, more commonly, entire animal skins (waterskins/wineskins) because these possessed the necessary properties of strength, relative impermeability, and ease of preparation for liquid storage.
