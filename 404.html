one, the sky, just, like, as image
also, the stars as noise -- randomly distributed
also noise -- the beach, the waves, the sand, the glimmer of sun on the water
the windows down 
noise as privacy

took off running and imagined the looney tunes cloud left behind in the general shape of my body
running off into the distance, i became an image
then, later, squatting and my friend approaches, feeling that image under the gaze, become activated
it becomes ironic or something. forced i guess. so it's funny. i smile and wave...

and then having a thought and saying it out loud in a way i could remember
and then a haiku results:
now that i remember
i can forget

And we don't have our final bodies yet. And 
and in that sense, we're like spectres 
ourselves online. The way we have our own 
online bodies that are spectral, made up of 
light. And just the many ways this can 
manifest. Youthful, spiritual, feminine. All 
these associated with light lightness and 
magic and transforming. Yeah and spirit 
animals connect to furries and vegans 
connect to ascetic monks and trans of 
course is Mind Body soul problem Yeah, 
furries, trans, vegans. These are examples in 
which our online bodies manifest in the real 
world, where we go into the spectral plane 
and when we come out we still have that 
identity. And it manifests itself in these ways 
that formerly might have been towards the 
extremes of urban identity. There's such a 
chaotic jumble. Mostly like, stratified, but 
there's just such a high volume, a critical 
mass of people, that there's room for this 
extra part.

am i authoring it?
on youtube i saw clickbait
i wanted to see a problematic star get taken down
but i also wanted to see that problematic in action
as something titillating, forbidden
a sort of clickbait
as something just to confirm myself as outside of that
to see a problematic force embodied outside of myself
where all that direction of hatred would hopefully go
and then
somehow actually feeling participatory on the internet
when i either open something in incognito mode
or i just don’t click on it
i don’t acknowledge that
i don’t participate in that reality
the idea of youtube as the aggregated pseudo A.I.
list of videos on the homescreen
entirely tailored to me
yet somehow still seeming universal
a reality that i create through my own participation
through my history
strange to see a video from six years ago
at 360p
today there’s 4k
um
resolution just the surface of the screen being the biggest
metric of advancement
really what else is there
viral memetic culture 
seems
part of its identity is that it seems arbitrary
random
there’s an element in there of chaos as well as fate
something that we all participate in
revel in that participation
cannot comprehend it
there’s also a sense of gangnam style
a video i never saw really
something i didn’t help to create
yet i feel included in that ‘we’ that created it
i could see similarly 
cultural stars at a certain level
kanye
also provoking this in people
a sense of how did we create this
a polarized sense of 
dismay or jubilation
this kind of resounding identification and
and a sort of violence that seems to occur
trump, same thing
‘this is me, this is my identity’
was this sort of subconscious of mine expressing itself?
